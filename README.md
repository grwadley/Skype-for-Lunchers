Skype-for-Lunchers
==================

Skype Bot for the League of Lunchers Chat
My only hesitation with making this public was that we would have tons of bots in chat all answering the same commands,
please don't make me regret posting this.

To Run:
ruby skype-lunchers2.rb

select desired chat, and let it go on its merry way.
All functionality it currently in skype-lunchers2.rb, external data is in text files. This could be made much more elegant.
